This test run on 22/04/17 at 11:18:33 on host Linux shubham 4.4.0-66-generic
#87-Ubuntu SMP Fri Mar 3 15:29:05 UTC 2017 x86_64.

Command: "fwts fan".
Running tests: fan.

fan: Simple fan tests.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test 1 of 2: Test fan status.
Test how many fans there are in the system. Check for the current status of the
fan(s).
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device0 of type Processor has max cooling state 3
and current cooling state 0.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device1 of type Processor has max cooling state 3
and current cooling state 0.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device2 of type Processor has max cooling state 3
and current cooling state 0.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device3 of type Processor has max cooling state 3
and current cooling state 0.
FAILED [MEDIUM] NoFanCurState: Test 1, Fan present but has no cur_state present.

Test 2 of 2: Load system, check CPU fan status.
Test how many fans there are in the system. Check for the current status of the
fan(s).
Loading CPUs for 20 seconds to try and get fan speeds to change.
Fan cooling_device0 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device1 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device2 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device3 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.

ADVICE: Did not detect any change in the CPU related thermal cooling device
states. It could be that the devices are returning static information back to
the driver and/or the fan speed is automatically being controlled by firmware
using System Management Mode in which case the kernel interfaces being examined
may not work anyway.
